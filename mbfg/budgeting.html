              Managing finances in the military can be challenging due to
              frequent relocations, deployments, and transitioning to civilian
              life. A solid budget helps ensure financial stability and makes
              the most of the unique benefits available to service members. This
              guide will help you create a budget, maximize your military
              benefits, and plan for the future.

            <h3>Understanding Your Military Pay & Benefits</h3>
            <p>
              Before building a budget, it's essential to understand all sources
              of income and benefits available to you.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Sources of Income:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Basic Pay - Your main salary, based on rank and years of
                service.
              </li>
              <li>
                Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) - Helps cover housing costs
                (varies by location and dependency status).
              </li>
              <li>
                Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) - Helps cover food
                expenses for service members.
              </li>
              <li>
                Special & Incentive Pays - Extra pay for specific duties (hazard
                pay, flight pay, sea pay, etc.).
              </li>
              <li>
                Tax-Free Benefits - Many allowances (like BAH & BAS) are not
                taxable, reducing your tax burden.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <h3>Creating a Military Budget</h3>
            <p>
              A good budget ensures you live within your means, save for the
              future, and prepare for unexpected expenses.
            </p>
            <h4>Steps to Create a Budget:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Track Your Income & Expenses - List all sources of income (base
                pay, BAH, BAS, bonuses). Track monthly expenses (rent,
                utilities, food, insurance, car payments, debt, entertainment).
              </li>
              <li>
                Use the 50/30/20 Rule - 50% Needs: Housing, food, insurance,
                transportation, essential bills. 30% Wants: Dining out,
                shopping, entertainment, hobbies. 20% Savings & Debt Repayment:
                Emergency fund, TSP contributions, extra debt payments.

            </ol>

            <h3>Saving for Emergencies & Deployment</h3>
            <p>
              Military life is unpredictable, so an emergency fund is crucial.
            </p>
            <h4>How Much Should You Save and Special Savings?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>3-6 Months of Expenses:</strong> Start with $1,000 and
                build up over time. Keep it in a separate, easy-to-access
                savings account.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Deployment Fund:</strong> Save extra for deployment
                expenses (childcare, pet care, travel, emergencies) of up to
                $10,000 during deployments. Combat Zone Tax Exclusion - Some or
                all of your earnings may be tax-free.
