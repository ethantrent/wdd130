                Absolutely! This is a good trip for children of all ages. We
                have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy
                it more overall (parents especially enjoy it more if their
                children are all over 8).

                The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful
                in the world, and you never know what you might see around any
                corner.

                As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
                element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
                certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
                years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are
                sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial
                rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal
                flotation device (PFD).

              <p>
                Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time.
                Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk
                before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for
                and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather

              <strong>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</strong>
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater
                rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. Arise in
                the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping
                under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of
                fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your
                things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some
                combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history,
                geology, stories, and more good food.
              </p>
              <p>
                We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you
                can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or
                explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner.

              <strong>How far in advance should I book my trip?</strong>
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>
                If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year
                in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is
                usually sufficient.
